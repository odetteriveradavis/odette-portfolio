            <p style="margin: 0 0 8px 0;"><strong>Scale:</strong> 6 brands, ~120 pages</p>
            <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Team:</strong> Cross-functional squad of 12 (3 content writers, 2 SEO specialists, 4 developers, 2 product managers, 1 CMS architect)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>In early 2024, I started tracking where Clearlink's telco sites (Brightspeed, Frontier, DISH, DIRECTV) were showing up in Google's SGE results. Turns out, they weren't. When users asked questions like "how does satellite internet work?" or "what's the difference between fiber and cable?", Google's AI was citing competitors and Reddit threads. We were completely invisible at the top of the funnel.</p>
            
            <p>The issue wasn't that we lacked good content. Our content just wasn't structured for how AI search works. SGE loves clear, well-organized answers. FAQs with schema markup, step-by-step guides, comparison tables. We had none of it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>I ran a content gap audit where I identified 20+ high-volume question patterns where we had zero presence. I then analyzed which content formats SGE was consistently surfacing, and structured, modular content was winning every time.</p>
            
            <p>Rather than building one-off pages, I designed three reusable content modules that could work across all six partner brands: FAQ accordions with schema markup, "How to Get Started" step-by-step guides with visual diagrams, and comparison tables showing our service vs. alternatives.</p>
            
            <p>I worked with product and CMS teams to build these as Contentful components that any specialist working on any brand could drop into pages without needing custom development. I led the content strategy, wrote usage documentation for the content team, trained the SEO and paid teams on best practices, and established governance so we could maintain quality as the system scaled. We ended up turning content gaps into a repeatable content system.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Outcome</h3>
            <div class="stats">
                <div class="stat">
                    <div class="stat-value">+21%</div>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We rolled out the modules across six partner sites in three months, and organic traffic to informational pages went up 21% (Q2 vs Q1 2024, measured in GA4 across ~120 pages). We went from ranking for zero out of 20 target queries to 14, and SGE started citing our content for 41% of the queries we targeted (tracked weekly via manual Google searches and logged in Google Sheets). We became the source Google's AI pointed to!</p>
            <p>Beyond the numbers, we built infrastructure so that when SEO identifies new gaps now, content and product can ship fixes in days instead of months.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>What mattered most:</strong> The modules forced teams to ask a different question. Not "what words go on this page?" but "how should this be organized so it's crawlable, reusable, and actually useful?" That shift changes everything about how you build content at scale. This same structured approach works for any discovery problem where users are searching for specific inventory like internet plans, concert tickets, or hotel rooms.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>What I'd do differently:</strong> We should have built measurement into the modules from day one. We tracked SGE citations manually for the first two months before automating it, which delayed our ability to optimize quickly. Next time, I'd partner with analytics earlier to build tracking into the component spec.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Our partner sites run constant promotions like "$200 off fiber installation" or "free HBO Max for 3 months." The problem was that every offer was hard-coded, so when a promo ended or pricing changed, someone had to manually hunt through dozens of pages to update copy. This created three issues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stale pricing showing up in search results (eroding trust and risking compliance violations)</li>
                <li>Bottlenecked content team spending ~10 hours per week on offer maintenance</li>
                <li>Frustrated partners whose offers either launched late or lingered past expiration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We were treating time-sensitive inventory like static content, and it was costing us.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>I partnered with product and CMS teams to build a lightweight offer management system in Contentful where offers would behave like product catalog data with expiration dates and centralized control. I led the initiative by building business cases for each stakeholder group. I showed SEO how it would prevent indexation of expired offers, demonstrated to legal how it would reduce compliance risks, and proved to content ops how it would free up ~50 hours/month.</p>
            
            <p>We built reusable offer modules that pulled pricing, promo language, and expiration dates from a central database, then added logic so offers would auto-expire and templatized common patterns so new promos could be set up in five minutes instead of 30+.</p>
            
            <p>I also documented usage rules around what fields were required, how to write compliant promo copy, and when to use which module so that SEO and paid teams could set up offers without needing content review every time.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Stale offers in search results erode trust the same way sold-out tickets do. When you're working with inventory that changes frequently, content needs to behave like product catalog data, synchronized with business logic, not locked in static pages. This approach applies to any time-sensitive inventory like event tickets, limited-time promotions, and flash sales.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>What took longer than expected:</strong> Getting buy-in from stakeholders who were used to having manual control. Some team members worried automation would introduce errors they couldn't catch. We solved this by building a review dashboard that showed all active offers at a glance and sent Slack alerts 48 hours before expiration. Trust came from visibility, not from removing all human oversight.</p>

        <span class="metric">Oura Ring · Content Strategy Lead (Contract) · 6 Olympic/pro athletes · Instagram, YouTube, TikTok</span>
        <div style="font-size: 14px; color: #666; background: #f8f8f8; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
            <p style="margin: 0 0 8px 0;"><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Content framework, athlete briefs, brand safety guidelines</p>
            <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Impact:</strong> Brand perception shift from "tech gadget" to "performance tool"</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Oura Ring needed to position itself as the recovery and performance tool for serious athletes rather than just tech enthusiasts. The brand had celebrity ambassadors like Olympic gold medalists and NBA players, but they weren't activating them in a way that told a cohesive story or drove product credibility with the sports and fitness audience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>I built an influencer strategy that let athletes tell real stories rather than just posting generic "I wear Oura" content. I worked with them to create narratives around how they actually used the ring during training, competition prep, and recovery.</p>

            <p>I worked with six Olympic and professional athletes to create authentic, performance-driven content:</p>

            <div class="athlete-grid">
                <div class="athlete-card">
                    <div class="athlete-name">Chris Paul</div>
                    <div class="athlete-title">NBA Player</div>
                </div>
                <div class="athlete-card">
                    <div class="athlete-name">Odell Beckham Jr.</div>
                    <div class="athlete-title">NFL Player</div>
                </div>
                <div class="athlete-card">
                    <div class="athlete-name">Katie Ledecky</div>
                    <div class="athlete-title">Olympic Swimmer</div>
                </div>
                <div class="athlete-card">
                    <div class="athlete-name">Lindsey Vonn</div>
                    <div class="athlete-title">Olympic Skier</div>
                </div>
                <div class="athlete-card">
                    <div class="athlete-name">Carissa Moore</div>
                    <div class="athlete-title">Olympic Surfer</div>
                </div>
                <div class="athlete-card">
                    <div class="athlete-name">Alix Klineman</div>
                    <div class="athlete-title">Olympic Beach Volleyball</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>For each athlete, I created content briefs that focused on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Training cycles:</strong> How they use sleep and recovery data during intense prep vs. off-season</li>
                <li><strong>Competition readiness:</strong> Pre-game/race routines informed by HRV and readiness scores</li>
                <li><strong>Injury prevention:</strong> Catching early signs of overtraining before it becomes a problem</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I also established brand safety guidelines and approval workflows to ensure content stayed authentic to each athlete's voice while hitting key product messaging (sleep quality, HRV tracking, readiness scores).</p>
            
            <div style="margin: 32px 0; text-align: center;">
                <img src="athlete-content-strategy.svg" alt="Framework showing how Oura Ring features (sleep, HRV, readiness) map to athlete use cases (training cycles, competition readiness, injury prevention)" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                <p style="margin-top: 12px; font-size: 13px; color: #999; font-style: italic;">Product-to-use-case mapping for authentic athlete storytelling</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Outcome</h3>
            <p>Created a repeatable content framework that Oura's team could use with future athlete ambassadors. Content performed organically across Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Athletes posted beyond their paid obligations because the content actually felt authentic to them.</p>
            <p>Social listening showed a measurable shift in brand perception. Before the campaign, Oura was positioned in conversations as a "tech gadget" or "wellness tracker." After, the dominant narrative shifted to "performance tool" and "recovery essential." The athlete content changed how people talked about the product!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> The best influencer content doesn't feel like marketing. Athletes have credibility when they talk about what matters to them (recovery, performance, injury prevention), not when they're reading from a script. My job was to give them a structure that let them tell their own stories while the product showed up naturally.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>What I'd do differently:</strong> I built the content framework after working with the first two athletes, which meant going back to revise their briefs. Next time, I'd start with a pilot round of interviews across all personas before writing any briefs, so the framework captures the full range of athlete motivations from day one.</p>

        <h2>Selling to an audience everyone ignores</h2>
        <span class="metric">Power Plate · Content Strategist (Contract) · Audience: 50-70+ · Mailchimp, Unbounce</span>
        <div style="font-size: 14px; color: #666; background: #f8f8f8; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 24px;">
            <p style="margin: 0 0 8px 0;"><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Email sequences, landing pages, video scripts</p>
            <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Results:</strong> 12,000+ leads, ~18% CVR (vs 10-12% industry benchmark)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Power Plate (whole-body vibration fitness equipment) wanted to reach older consumers who don't typically engage with fitness marketing. The challenge was figuring out how to talk to people in their 50s, 60s, and 70s without patronizing them or using that generic "healthy aging" language that makes people feel old.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>I focused on what this demographic actually cares about like maintaining independence, staying active with grandkids, recovering from injuries faster, and avoiding the limitations they see in their peers.</p>
            
            <p>I wrote email sequences and landing page copy that led with those outcomes rather than product features, keeping the tone direct and respectful without any condescension or anti-aging clichés.</p>
            
            <p>I also wrote video scripts for influencer content featuring Mark Wahlberg that positioned Power Plate as a tool for people who want results without spending hours in the gym.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Outcome</h3>
            <p>Generated 12,000+ unique leads over six months with a landing page conversion rate of ~18% (industry benchmark for direct-to-consumer fitness is typically 10-12%). The email sequences had strong open and click rates because the messaging actually resonated with an audience that's used to being ignored or talked down to by wellness brands.</p>
            
            <div style="margin: 32px 0; text-align: center;">
                <img src="email-campaign-dashboard.svg" alt="Email sequence performance showing conversational subject lines that drove +23% open rate improvement for 50-70+ audience" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                <p style="margin-top: 12px; font-size: 13px; color: #999; font-style: italic;">Campaign results: 12,000+ leads at 18% CVR</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Why it worked:</strong> Older consumers have money and motivation, but most fitness brands optimize for 25-year-olds. When you speak to what they actually care about (mobility, independence, not feeling like they're declining), they respond. The Mark Wahlberg content helped because he's aspirational for that age group without being unrealistic.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>What surprised me:</strong> The email sequences initially had lower open rates than expected because the subject lines were too benefit-focused and felt like spam. When we tested more conversational subject lines ("A quick question about your knees" vs "Recover faster from joint pain"), open rates jumped 23%. Older audiences are even more skeptical of marketing language than younger ones.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Tripp VR (a meditation app for VR headsets) had strong product-market fit but weak conversion because their landing pages spoke in tech language like "immersive psychedelic experiences" and "binaural audio" rather than addressing actual user pain points. Traffic was coming in, but purchase intent wasn't converting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>I started with qualitative research: app store reviews, support tickets, Reddit threads. I wasn't looking for what people said they wanted. I was looking for the problems they were trying to solve. Three personas kept showing up:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Burnout Professional:</strong> high-stress job, looking for a quick mental reset</li>
                <li><strong>The Psychedelic-Curious:</strong> interested in altered states but not ready for substances</li>
                <li><strong>The Sleep-Deprived Parent:</strong> desperate for better rest, open to unconventional solutions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I rewrote landing pages to lead with outcomes, not features. "Can't turn your brain off at night?" instead of "Experience binaural audio meditation." I restructured the IA so users could self-select into persona-specific flows rather than forcing everyone through a generic funnel.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 12px; font-size: 13px; color: #999; font-style: italic;">Research synthesis that drove 55% sales increase</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>The Outcome</h3>
            <p>55% sales increase in Q4 2021 compared to Q3 2021. Lower bounce rate on homepage (exact percentage not tracked post-project). The founder told me it was the first time their marketing sounded like their actual users.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>The insight:</strong> People don't buy features. They buy solutions to problems they're actively experiencing. The research phase made everything else work. You have to listen to how users actually talk about their needs before you can write content that converts.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px;"><strong>What didn't work at first:</strong> My initial persona-specific landing pages were too segmented. Users didn't want to self-identify as "burnout professional" or "sleep-deprived parent" in navigation. We pivoted to a universal homepage that led with outcomes, then let users naturally flow into persona-specific messaging based on which problem they clicked. Sometimes the best UX is invisible.</p>
